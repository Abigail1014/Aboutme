# Aboutme




Hello wave,I am a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, a final-years system engineering student pursuing MERN Stack development from Bolivia. Since 2022, I have been gaining hands-on experience by learning from various resources and developing custom projects according to industrial standards, with a particular focus on software development. 

Crafting ideas into web-based realities is my forte, which enables me to possess the following skills:
• Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js.
• Back-End: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Firebase, and REST APIs
• Tools: Postman and GitHub

I would like to innovate in my startups in the world.
